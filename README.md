# JobRADAR: Job Notification Agent for the Students by the Students üöÄ

## Problem We Are Solving üì¢
As students, we have faced significant challenges while searching for jobs. The biggest issue is not receiving interview calls, even after applying to thousands of places. One of the main reasons for this is the overwhelming volume of applications that entry-level jobs receive. Within just a few hours of posting, these jobs can have thousands of applicants, reducing the chances of skilled candidates even passing the initial ATS screening.

To address this, we created **JobRADAR**: A job notification agent that crawls major Big Tech career pages every 15 minutes and sends you an email notification whenever a new job is posted. This way, you can apply immediately before the application pool becomes saturated, improving your chances of getting noticed.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Automated Job Crawling**: Monitors job postings every 15 minutes.
- **Personalized Notifications**: Sends an email with job details, including job ID, position, and link.
- **Customizable Searches**: Allows users to add their own crawlers for desired companies.
- **Open Source & Contributable**: Set up and run locally or contribute to the project!

## How to Set Up JobRADAR Locally üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 1: Find and Add Your Job URL üåç
1. Download the project repository.
2. Navigate to `job_crawlers-main/urls/urls.json`.
3. For each company, add an array of job URLs. Example:
   ```json
   "Google": [
       "https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/jobs/results/?q=product%20manager&location=United%20States&target_level=EARLY&degree=MASTERS&employment_type=FULL_TIME"
   ]
   ```
4. Find job URLs on the career sites of your preferred companies and add them to the JSON file.

### Step 2: Email Setup for Job Notifications üìß
1. Open `job_crawlers-main/email_config/email_setup.py`.
2. Update the following function with your Gmail credentials:
   ```python
   def send_email(job_details_list, receiverEmail=None):
       from_email = "ENTER_YOUR_EMAIL"
       from_password = "ENTER_YOUR_PASSWORD"
       print("In send email function " + receiverEmail)
       to_email = receiverEmail
   ```
3. Set up Google SMTP for secure email sending.

### Step 3 (Optional): Add Your Own Crawlers ü§ñ
1. Navigate to `job_crawlers-main/crawlers`.
2. Each crawler is designed for a specific company.
3. The crawlers are asynchronous to handle multiple job sites efficiently.
4. Modify or add new crawlers as needed.

### Step 4: Start the Crawler üöÄ
1. Open `main.py`.
2. Specify which company you want to track.
3. Run the script to initiate job tracking:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
